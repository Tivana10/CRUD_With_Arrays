This Java program is an Movie Management System with a simple and user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) built using JFrame.
It allows users to add, view, update, and delete Movies. 
Each Movie/Series has an ID, name, Age restriction, Number of episodes, and all data is stored temporarily in an ArrayList while the program is running and then into a JSON file. 
The interface uses text fields for input, buttons for actions, and a display area to show movie details.
Feedback messages help users know when actions are successful or if something is wrong.
The project uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with separate classes for Series and managing data.
